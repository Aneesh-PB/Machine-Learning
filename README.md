# Machine-Learning

This repository consists of Microprojects done by me in machine learning

1. Diamond price prediction using XGBoost model. This project uses an inbuilt sample dataset from google colab.
   
2. Credit card fraud detection by applying different types of machine learning algorithms and finding the best algorithm. The dataset used is a masked dataset.
